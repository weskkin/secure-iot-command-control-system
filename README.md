# Secure IoT Command and Control System

A secure system for sending authenticated and encrypted commands to IoT devices, built for a Cybersecurity Master's course.

## Project Overview

This project implements a secure command and control system for IoT devices with focus on:

- End-to-end encryption using TLS/SSL
- Mutual authentication between devices and command center
- Protection against common security threats (MitM, replay attacks, etc.)
- Secure coding practices

## Components

- **Command Center**: Web interface for sending commands to IoT devices
- **Device Simulators**: Python applications that simulate IoT devices
- **MQTT Communication**: Secure protocol for command transmission
- **Certificate Management**: Custom Certificate Authority for device authentication

## Security Features

- TLS/SSL encryption for all communications
- Certificate-based mutual authentication
- Digital signatures for command integrity
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive logging and auditing

## Setup Instructions

(Coming soon)

## Development Status

This project is currently in early development.
